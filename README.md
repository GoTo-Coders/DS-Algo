## Our Goal:
The goal is to have in a single place for all possible **Data Structures and Algorithm** solutions - in multiple languages. We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want!We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want, just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.Our organization provides a common platform where all the passionate coders can contribute and uplift themselves as well as the organization.  
It is our goal to provide access to well written, well-explained programs and knowledge that improve people's lives. 
We want to enable people to adapt and change code according to their own ideas through an Open Access approach. 
We bring amazing people together to code algorithms and share our work for the benefit of all.

## Guidelines for contribution:
- Plagiarism is strictly not allowed. Any work that is found to be suspicious of plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Issues will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in detail your improvement. This will help others to analyze 
your contribution.

## How to upload files:
#### PLEASE READ THIS
- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in Python, it goes inside the DS folder 
within the Python folder and so on)
- Edit the corresponding README.md file to add the link to your code in the corresponding section.
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so.**
- Also, be polite with the reviewers - they will be ALWAYS polite to you.
