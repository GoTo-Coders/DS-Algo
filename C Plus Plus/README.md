# Overview-
The goal is to have in a single place for all possible **Data Structures and Algorithm** solutions - in multiple languages. We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want!.

# GuideLine For Contribution-
Please create an issue if you wish to add code in a language that is not currently here. Do not create folders in your submissions unless specifically told to do so.


### Graphs:
- [Dijkstra’s Algorithm](Graph/Dijkstra's_Algorithm.cpp)
- [Floyd Warshall's Algorithm](Graph/Floyd_Warshall.cpp)
- [Breadth-First Search Algorithm](Graph/Breadth_First_Search.cpp)
- [Hamiltonian Cycle](Graph/Hamiltonian_Cycle.cpp)
- [Depth First Search](Graph/Depth_First_Search.cpp)

### Searching and Sorting:
- [Bucket or Bin Sort](Searching_and_Sorting/Bucket_or_Bin_Sort.cpp)
- [Merge Sort](Searching_and_Sorting/MergeSort.cpp)


### Trie:
- [Trie implementation](Trie/Trie.cpp)
